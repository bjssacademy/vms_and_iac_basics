# Azure Virtual Machine Creation

This page outlines the creation of an Azure Virtual Machine using the Azure Portal.
In this exercise we will Create a Resource Group, A Vnet and Subnet and deploy a VM with the Nginx Webserver on it. This will be assigned a public IP address so it is acessible from the internet.

The setup looks like this:

## Testing
---

Now that we have created our VM we should be able to access the NGINX Webserver using it's Public IP:

1. Get the public IP of your VM.

![copy_ip](./images/copy_ip.png)

2. Now, paste it's IP address into the address bar in your web browser. 
3. You should see the default index page for the Nginx Web Server.
