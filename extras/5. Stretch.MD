# Description
If we got here then you finished the tasks very quickly, so here are some ideas if you want to go further.


# Ideas

## Create a public S3 Bucket in AWS using Terraform
* Use a free AWS account
* Setup a new project with the AWS provider
* Create a public S3 Bucket with static-site hosting
* Use terraform to create an index page

## Use Terraform to Create a Nginx VM in AWS
:warning: use a T3.Micro they are free. Don't deploy an expensive VM as these can be costly!

* You will need to create a VPC with an Internet gateway a Subnet and a VM with a public IP
* Terraform has a module that lets you create the above in an easier way: https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws/latest
* If you only deploy 1x `T3.Micro` it will come under your free plan
* The AWS equivalent of a bootscript in AWS is a `userdata` script

:warning: Don't forget to terraform destroy. If you mess up just make sure you clear down everything, unused public IPs incur a small fee.


## Extend the Azure VM Terraform Exercise
Using TF create your own Terraform to Deploy a VM as per the first IaaS exercise (no peeking).

Here are some ideas to extend the example:
* Lock down the Security groups to only allow access from your own external IP: https://whatismyipaddress.com/
* Install a different application other than NGINX (please bare in mind this is publiclly accessible, no default passwords!)
* See if you can calculate a smaller CIDR range that is better suited to your deployment
* Try adding a load balancer in front of your VM instead of assigning an ip directly
* Add a second VM and load balance between the two
